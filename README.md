# Linear-Regression-to-estimate-days-of-inventory

Kavak is transforming the way of selling and buying a used car, making car ownership accessible, safe, fast, and convenient for all their clients. Currently, Kavak has 5 showrooms in Mexico City and the Metropolitan Area. Nowadays, every time a car is purchased, the decision of sending that car to a particular showroom is taken essentially randomly. 
Kavak was interested in predicting the estimated days of inventory a prospective car would have in each showroom in order to define the optimal destination with the fastest turnover rate. This would increase the company's profit and reduce operative costs.

Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook with different types of graphs to made some exploratory data analysis for a first approach to the problem.

Linear_Regression_postgresdb.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that extracts informati√≥n from a Postgres database, it has a linear regression model to predict the days of inventory for each showroom.

LinearRegression_model.py is the production file to run the final algorithm
